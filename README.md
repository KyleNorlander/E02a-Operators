# E02a-Operators
I needed alot of help on this one. By using the provided material and plenty of google searches/stackoverflow questions I was able to input these different operators to create several lists, and some in reverse. I was also able to randomize certain sets of data (mostly numbers) and create new lists of sequential numbers. Very confusing and I'm so damn glad this one is over! :D
